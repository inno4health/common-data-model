# Inno4Health Common Health Data Model

## About

This repository includes the FHIR profiles definitions which constitute the Common Health Data Model of the Inno4Health Project.

The Common Data Model of the Inno4Health Project is implemented using [HL7 FHIR profiles](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/profiling.html). 
This repository includes a [FHIR CapabilityStatement](http://www.hl7.org/fhir/capabilitystatement.html) which references 
to the profile definitions on different FHIR resources including the [ValueSet](http://www.hl7.org/fhir/valueset.html) & [CodeSystem](http://www.hl7.org/fhir/codesystem.html) definitions.

This repository can be directly used to start an [onFHIR Repository](https://onfhir.io/) instance.
